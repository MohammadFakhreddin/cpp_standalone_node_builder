# Cpp code runner with node js 
This project can be used to run your code easily using terminal,And code in any editor you want in any OS

## How to run code 
For first time type to install dependencies
```
npm install
```
To build javascript code of build tools
```
npm run build_tools
```
This compiles build tools from typescript to javascript.
>Warning: After editing build tool script you need to compile again

>You can change it inside main.ts 

For running code type 
```
npm run compile 
```
It would compile all .cpp and .c files inside src and run the code if no error exists

I wrote this code to write c++ code without need for visual studio and xCode to run them

## TODO 
I have to create makefile instead of running from command line in feature
